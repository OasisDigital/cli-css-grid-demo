# Angular CLI - CSS Grid Demo

## Thesis

Today, early December 2017, is the time to begin using CSS grid for layout in
Angular applications, even if they must support Internet Explorer. We can stop
enduring the costs and delays of legacy CSS layout misery, and get better
results with less work, using CSS Grid.

See this simple example online:

It works on both modern browsers and IE11 (maybe 10).

## Background

This simple demo is hopefully a bit more interesting than it first appears. It
uses CSS grid layout, plus various workarounds for support in Internet Explorer
11 and Angular CLI 1.6.1, which does not yet have the needed versions and
settings to make things easy.
